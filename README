Hi! Welcome to my repository for my python practice. 

One of my science teachers from High School, Dr. Frewen, told me about this website called www.projecteuler.net when I was in 8th grade. 
We were talking about ways to quickly get familiar with a language, and he said that one of the best ways was to use this website and solve, say, 50 problems. 
He said it was effective at doing this because the websites problems are all number puzzles, so it really forces you to construct your code in a way that's efficient â€“ which requires lots of familiarity with the language. 
I was trying to learn C at the time, but he was always a big fan of Python and was always encouraging me to try out Python at the time, so this summer I decided to give it a shot because I had more free time.

I've completed 17 problems so far, and everytime I get that green check mark on the website it's the best :D
As a result, I've been able to automate a lot of operations/calculations for problem sets and it even helped with calculations for a thermo presentation - just had to make sure my units were right. ALWAYS double check your units.
I've always done coding here and there, but I figured doing the project euler method would be a great way to give myself some structure to learning a language.

Doing this has worked pretty well so far, so I'm going to continue during this winter break like I did during the summer! Putting it on github will also let me keep track of my progress, and also so Ryan can check it out. 

Thanks for reading, and thanks Dr. Frewen!
